# AirBnB clone - Web Static(HTML and CSS Styling)

Welcome to one phase of the Airbnb Clone project, focusing on the HTML and CSS implementation. In the Images folder, you'll find a collection of icons crucial to the site's visual elements, including the logo, bathroom icons, bedroom icons, and guest icons. The Styles folder contains CSS files responsible for styling various components. Pay attention to the highest-numbered style file in each category (e.g., common, footer, header, places) as it reflects the most recent changes and is most relevant to the final appearance.

For a holistic view of the current state of the project, refer to the highest-numbered index.html file, which encapsulates the latest developments and represents the most advanced version of the finished product.
